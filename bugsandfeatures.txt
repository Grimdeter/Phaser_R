Bugs:
    +after taking a card in phase2, new cards are printed on top of existing 
    +a lot of cards are on table after exiting punish
    +after playing card it still renders
    +consistency of card played and card back 
    +take breaks the game Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'destroy' of undefined gamePhase2.js?17f9:496 
    -10 cards in the hand of player is maximum
    -doesnt render cardBacks after exiting toPunish and punish 
    -in punish, after new card, many cards are rendered infinetly
    -if move is illegal. the card is still taken out
    -Cannot read property 'hitArea' of undefined after punish (gamephase 122 maybe?) (the problem can be the scenes being run in the background)
    -after punish must save cards that are on table already
    -multiple same cards are rendered after exiting punish (having different events for different scenes might solve the problem)
